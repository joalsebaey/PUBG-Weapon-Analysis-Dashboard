# 🔫 Weapon Data Analysis

A detailed exploratory analysis project based on weapon attributes, including type, bullet caliber, damage, fire rate, and more. The visualizations offer insights into weapon performance for gamers, game designers, or enthusiasts interested in balancing, comparing, or optimizing weapons.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Understand the **distribution** of weapon and bullet types.
- Identify **top-performing weapons** based on metrics like damage, rate of fire, and DPS.
- Visualize **correlations** between numeric attributes.
- Explore **bullet types** used across weapon categories.
- Compare **average damage and shots to kill** per weapon group.

## 📊 Visuals Include:

- Number of weapons by type and bullet type
- Damage vs Fire Rate scatter plots
- Box plots of DPS by weapon and bullet type
- Correlation matrix of numeric weapon stats
- Radar chart comparing top weapons across multiple metrics
- Summary statistics by bullet type
- Average shots to kill (Chest vs Head) by category

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- I/O and CSV parsing  
- Radar and box plots  

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Install required packages:

##📄 Dataset
The dataset is embedded directly in the script as a multiline CSV string. No external files needed.

##💡 Applications
